    "    <li>Curently, I'm thinking read in the capacity report outside of the iterative loop, and read in/extract the relevant capacity vector per school.</li></br>\n",
    "    <li>I think the question is whether or not identifying if demand per POS could be met is a value-added for now? I think it is, and the move is to read in the appropriate vector here and compare.</li>\n",

    "### Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "This is inappropriate to do so here before the uncoupling of bundled POS. Otherwise, such assignments or checks is premature and misleading. For example in C.most_common()[1] for schools[0] is a 3-bundled POS. Comparing len(rooms) to len(C.most_common()) results in 19 to 13, but there are actually 19 POS pathways. It's not 6 rooms extra. It's at minimum viable.</br></br> <strong><u>!!!FLAG!!!</u></strong></br>\n",

    "### Future Development\n",

    "Possibility: add in clause to let the algorithm be greedy if there are extra rooms provided by school, based on the capacity report. \n",

    "## Capacity Vector structure\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Previously, the capacity vector was a simple array of the length of the school's provided rooms with entries of 50/35 per lg/sm room distinction.</li></br>\n",
    "    <li>In an attempt to handle both the much broader range of capacities per room and make assigning rooms easier in the scheduling process, a school's capacity vector as built by beta_capacity_report.py is a dictionary that has room names/numbers as keys and corresponding capacity as values. </li></br>\n",
    "    <li><strong>IDEA:</strong> add the assigned pathway to the respective key/value pair. For ex: {'Library':40} -> {'Library':[40, 'BioSTEM']}</li></br>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision -Delayed\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCERN: we do not have enough information for this year's event currently. Going off of last year's data we can decide what room assignments could be changed, but this year's data has not included assigned pathways to rooms. \n",
    "As is, the assigned capacity vector(s) can be exported as a DF ready to be read in by the schedule building script, and included in schools' folders for organizational purposes. "
