    "Previous years documents showed that the YouScience results per school provided by the county included students that were not in 8th grade. The relavent purpose within the algorithm of the original notebook was to filter the YouScience files to 8th graders and track those 8th graders that did not have YouScience results. \n",

    "    <li>(T) Known issue: there are non-8th grade students in raw YouScience files, the YouScience files do have a \"grad_year\" feature, so if you know the grad year you can also just filter them that way</li></br>\n",
    "    <li>(T) Known issue: currently, at least one school's skyward files has duplicated students (resolve by droping duplicates on student email feature)</li></br>\n",
    "    <li>(T) Be aware: related to the second issues, future skyward rosters should be filtered to the 3rd quearter records, which might resolve duplicated students, but as is, point 2 won't break anything regardless</li></br>\n",
    "    <li>(E) Export: incoming you science docs have titles in the format \"YouScience_Cluster_Advising_{school}.xlsx\", exported updated files are expected to be titled like \"{schoo}_YouScience.xlsx\"</li></br>\n",
    "    <li>(F) Future exploration: while irrelavent to the current iteration of the algorith, the youscience file does include sex (binary) and ethnicity features. Long term, I initially thought to use these features in part to create metrics for efficacy of the sorting algorithm.</li></br>\n",
